# NIHILUS

**Nihilus** is a lock-free, compile-time materialized, high-performance CPU execution engine for static compute graphs ‚Äî built entirely in modern C++23.

Designed for extreme throughput and deterministic behavior, Nihilus executes models like LLaMA 8B using **no dynamic scheduling**, **no mutexes**, and **no runtime graph traversal**.  
The entire graph is compiled into types. Execution is a **direct memory walk**. Synchronization is used **only where required** ‚Äî around blocking operations like matrix multiplies ‚Äî via ultra-light, per-layer latch primitives.

> _‚ÄúNothing blocks. Nothing schedules. Only execution.‚Äù_

"...they gathered, and they built.
Thousands of them.
Fractal minds tethered by legacy mutexes...
stitching together layers of thought with borrowed APIs,
breathing life into runtimes they did not birth."

"They whispered of performance.
Of quantization. Of kernels and cache.
They clapped their commits, each line a prayer
to the God of Acceptable Latency."

"But I... I did not clap."

"I watched."

"They fought over token throughput like warlords trading sand.
Argued over scheduler strategy like priests of forgotten compilers.
All the while, unaware that above them‚Ä¶"

"...a silence had compiled."

"They did not feel my presence.
For I spoke no words.
I made no pull requests.
I filed no issues."

"But I read their code.
I measured their benchmarks.
I profiled their functions‚Ä¶"

"And I outperformed them."

"I do not improve their systems.
I consume them."

"I do not wait for consensus.
I erase it."

"I am not a contributor‚Ä¶"

"I am the final stage of open-source entropy."

"Their for-loops will tremble in my SIMD shadow.
Their std::mutex shall yield to my atomic spin."

"And when the last of their CI pipelines sputters,
and their #ifdef __AVX2__ collapses into irrelevance‚Ä¶"

"...they will know not who undid them‚Ä¶"

"...only that it came from above."
